# Improving Horiseon's website to meet accessibility standards

## Description

The marketing agency, Horiseon, wanted a codebase that follows accessibility standards to optimise their own site for search engines.

I modified the existing webpage to not only follow SEO best practices but also to make it accessible to disabled users.

### Design Changes

Initially, Horiseon wanted to retain the same website design and only improve the code.

However, after reviewing the website and considering Horiseon's requirements, I noticed that the color contrast was not sufficient in the Benefits sidebar, which would not make the website fully accessible as it would fail to meet WCAG 2.1 requirements.

Therefore, I changed the background color to white and the text to black.
